            <Paragraph>
              The Critics Score is a single, aggregated numerical score on a <strong>0-100 scale</strong>. It represents the consensus of professional tech reviewers and reputable tech content creators, including established YouTubers.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Our methodology employs a <strong>weighted average model</strong>. Key factors influencing the weighting include:
            </Paragraph>
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-4">
              <ListItem>
                <strong>Source Authority/Reputation:</strong> Publications and reviewers with a history of rigorous, independent testing and long-standing reputations (e.g., CNET, TechRadar, Tom's Guide) receive higher weights.
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                <strong>Review Depth/Technicality:</strong> More in-depth reviews that provide technically validated assessments carry more weight than superficial overviews.
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                <strong>Score Normalization:</strong> We utilize AI-driven techniques to normalize scores from various rating scales (e.g., 5-star, 10-point, letter grades) to our standard 0-100 scale, ensuring fair comparisons.
              </ListItem>
            </ul>
            <Paragraph>
              We are committed to transparency in our weighting and normalization processes. While the exact weights are dynamic and algorithmically adjusted, the principles guiding them remain consistent.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph className="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
              For example, a highly detailed review from a top-tier publication might contribute more significantly to the final Critics Score than a brief mention from a less established source. All scores are converted to a 0-100 scale before averaging.
            </Paragraph>
          </div>

            <Paragraph>
              The Audience Rating is a separate numerical score, also on a <strong>0-100 scale</strong>, reflecting the collective sentiment of everyday users and consumers.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Data sources for the Audience Rating include:

              <ListItem>
                User-submitted reviews directly on the TechScore platform.

              <ListItem>

            </ul>
            <Paragraph>
              To ensure authenticity and prevent score manipulation (e.g., "fan-skewed" or "review-bombed" scores), we implement <strong>robust outlier detection and handling mechanisms</strong>.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              We are continuously exploring strategies to maintain the integrity of audience ratings, such as systems for verifying user reviews (e.g., through proof of purchase where feasible).
